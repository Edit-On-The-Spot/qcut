        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Qcut</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") — owned and operated by{" "}

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
        <p>

            <strong>Anonymous analytics (optional):</strong> to improve stability and usability, using aggregated

        </ul>
        <p>
          You can disable analytics collection in your browser or device settings without affecting access to Qcut.
